Spotify Playlist

The app will generate a playlist for a trip using Spotify API. 

This will be a command lines app that will receive as arguments number of hours for the trip and also one or more music genres (optional). 

If there are no genres specified it should get a random lists of songs that get close to the time.

Then it will get a list of songs using the API and show them in a table.

The table will show:

- Song title
- Artist
- Song duration
- At the bottom: Total number of songs and Total duration of the list

The table will have this options:

- Try again: get another list of songs
- Get playlist URL: ask the API to save this list of songs in a new playlist and get the URL
